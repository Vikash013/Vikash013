### Software Developer

<p>🏞 My journey into the world of software development began in August 2022. From engaging videos to insightful articles and inspiring discussions with peers and mentors, I discovered my passion for coding and problem-solving.</p>

<p>Ever since I have been self-learning by using resources like tutorials and platforms such as freeCodeCamp ⛺, YouTube ▶️ and Stack Overflow 📚. Through this process, I've built various projects that continuously expand my knowledge and skills as a software developer.</p>
